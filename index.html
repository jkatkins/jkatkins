    Take big steps to eval, like a nomad<br/>
    Bind and return like a Monad<br/>
    about the signature I got you using<br/>
    in the directory with the MLI files the compiler was choosing<br/>
    <br/>
    The type checks out, I'm feeling greater<br/>
    Defer the value now and I return a little later<br/>
    Cuz I'm threaded, so for now I ain't got much to say<br/>
    I put a semicolon on to throw the unit away<br/>
    <br/>
At this point, I only know what you know that we know<br/>
I fill up the Monad like it's a burrito<br/>
And I read it, I'm never defeated, bind and retrieve it<br/>
with anonymous functions, so that I'm never gonna leave it behind<br/>
<br/>
And don't worry, in case you haven't heard<br/>
I'm bout to Ivar.read it and put it up in a deferred<br/>
Or I could ref it and bang it for an immutable copy<br/>
And just a little later, you can call me A$YNC ROCKY<br/>
<br/>
Try to stop me, I wouldn't care, I'd be ambivalent<br/>
It's the same game, behavioral equivalence<br/>
And I don't even think that you was all that<br/>
Your scheduler was so lonely it couldn't ever get a callback<br/>
<br/>
And really that's the kind of thing that you couldn't handle<br/>
Because my double semicolons got them screaming OH CAML<br/>
Side effects, catch them all, now you know we got 'em<br/>
All up in UTOP but I started on the bottom<br/>
<br/>
So please take a second and just listen (listen) <br/>
Up in your speakers I'm wishin to write a weaker precondition<br/>
Took a few small steps, I was feeling like a dope<br/>
Now I'm up in OCaml, we using lexical scope<br/>
<br/>
But once again I need to try to understand this, <br/>
All these pedantic antics tripping up my semantics<br/>
I can stress, how much I really want to do it all<br/>
But once it's said I can't take it back it's immutable<br/>
<br/>
And there was only one course plan<br/>
Turning twenty-one, going on 3110<br/>
But really, at this moment, I'm still living in terror<br/>
Because the type checker be giving me compile time errors<br/>
<br/>
The C A M L, with an O at the front<br/>
It's not imperative scaring ya, and we ain't tryna stunt<br/>
Just tryna process every single type to keep it in check<br/>
And having higher-order fun with it is just a side effect<br/>
<br/>
