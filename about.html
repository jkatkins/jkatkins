    About and Projects link here. This website is a work in progress, 
    I try to make new changes every week. My immediate future plans are to 
    make a proper About page, and add some samples of my Unity games to the 
    project page. In the meantime, you can check out my resume 
    <a href="resume.html">here</a>, or go back to the home page
